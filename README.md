NextAGIFuture aims to be an open-source platform for developing large language model (LLM) applications. It is an LLM-based application utilizing the concepts of
LangChain and LangGraph. The goal is to create a suite of LLMOps solutions that supports chatbots, RAG applications, agents, and multi-agent systems, with the capability for offline operation.

Inspired by the [StreetLamb](https://github.com/StreetLamb) project and its [tribe](https://github.com/StreetLamb/tribe) project , NextAGIFuture adopts much of the approach and code.
Building on this foundation, it introduces some new features and directions of its own.
